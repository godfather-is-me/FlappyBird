# Flappy Bird Remake

To learn the intricacies of java, I created the remake of the flappy bird using the bagel game engine.

To run the program simply download the project, run the .xml to install dependencies via Maven and run the ShadowFlap main class. A window will pop up to play the game, and all instructions are set up.
